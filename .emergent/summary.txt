The previous AI engineer initiated work to expand an existing application into a comprehensive Airbnb-like platform. The core task involved adding several missing frontend screens: Login, Registration, User Profile/Settings, Marketplace Dashboard, Host Dashboard, Booking Management, and Messages/Chat. Initially, the environment description suggested a React/FastAPI/MongoDB stack, but the engineer quickly identified the codebase as a Flutter application, leading to a critical mismatch. Despite this, the engineer proceeded to create the requested Flutter UI components and update the routing. The process concluded abruptly when it was discovered that the Flutter SDK was not installed in the environment, rendering the newly added frontend code untestable and unusable. The previous engineer recognized this fundamental issue as the blocker, preventing further progress or testing of the implemented features.

The user requested to complete an existing application, transforming it into a comprehensive Airbnb-like platform. This involves implementing several key screens and functionalities:
-   **Login Screen**: For user authentication.
-   **Registration Screen**: For new user sign-ups.
-   **User Profile and Settings Screen**: To manage user information and application preferences.
-   **Marketplace Dashboard**: Likely for browsing and discovering listings.
-   **Host Dashboard**: For property owners to manage their listings and bookings.
-   **Booking Management**: To view, create, and manage bookings.
-   **Messages and Chat Screen**: For communication between users and hosts.

The existing app structure was a Flutter application, which already had some base components like Splash, Onboarding, Home Dashboard, Listing Details, and a basic Messages and Chat setup. The explicit goal was to make the app complete and comprehensive with a consistent design.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Flutter**: The primary framework used for the frontend development of the application.
-   **Dart**: The programming language used by Flutter.
-   **Project Structure**: Standard Flutter application layout, with  for UI components and  for navigation.
-   **Environment Mismatch**: Critical issue where the application is Flutter but the environment is configured for React/FastAPI and lacks Flutter SDK.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application discovered is a Flutter project, residing within the  directory. While the initial system prompt indicated a React frontend, the actual codebase structure confirmed Flutter.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Environment Setup**: Install and configure Flutter SDK in the environment.
-   **Application Testing**: Test all newly implemented Flutter screens and their navigation.
-   **Backend Integration**: No backend work has been done; API contracts and integration with a FastAPI backend (as suggested by the system prompt) are pending.
-   **Full Functionality**: The newly created screens are UI shells; full functionality (e.g., authentication logic, data fetching/submission for dashboards) is pending.
-   **Messages and Chat**: While a screen existed, further development to make it complete and comprehensive was requested but not explicitly addressed.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer had just completed adding the foundational UI for all the requested new screens (Login, Registration, Marketplace Dashboard, User Profile/Settings, Host Dashboard, Booking Management) and updated the  file to enable navigation to these screens. The work included creating dedicated  files for each main screen and several associated widgets within their respective directories (e.g., ).

The engineer then attempted to restart the services to check the changes, only to encounter critical environment errors. The supervisor logs indicated an attempt to run a React frontend, which conflicted with the discovered Flutter application. Further investigation confirmed that the Flutter SDK itself was not installed in the environment, leading to a flutter: not found error when attempting to execute Flutter commands. This environmental misconfiguration is the immediate blocker.
